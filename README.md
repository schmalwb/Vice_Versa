# Vice_Versa
This repository contains code files and intermediary computations related to the paper "Vice Versa: The Decoupling of Content and Topic Heterogeneity in Collusion Research"
The paper has been published in the academic Journal of Economic Surveys and can be found here: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joes.12600  (fully open access)
The main file is codefile1, written in R. codefile2 and codefile3 are auxiliary codefiles written in STATA to execute a matrix reshape (codefile #2) or else to compute the VAR analysis in chapter 3.5 of the paper.
In addition, you need the provided csv and xlsx files as well as the STATA do file to execute some tasks as outlined in the main code file.

Please either regenerate the provided csv datafiles or else call them in R and STATA as described in the codefiles. Please ensure that the csvs are placed in the working directory or else adjust the filepaths to import them properly.
